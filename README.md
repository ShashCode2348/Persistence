# Persistence
A project on Multiplicative Persistence. 
Persistence is when the digits of a number are multiplied together to get a new number, and this repeats with the new number. The amount of repeats before getting to a single digit is called the number's persistence. 
In the project you can find the persistence of a number, or the smallest number for persistence 1, 2, etc. The maximum value tested(10000000 in the project) can be changed.
