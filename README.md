# Persistence

## About

A Python project on multiplicative persistence. 

## Background Information

Persistence is when the digits of a number are multiplied together to obtain a new number, which repeats with the new number. The number of steps before getting to a single digit is called the number's persistence. 

In the project you can find the persistence of a number, or the smallest number for persistence e.g. 1,2,3... The maximum value tested (10000000 by default) can be changed. It's time for you to put it to the test!
